# Useful C++ Algorithms

A collection of useful implementations written in C++.

The repository is organized in individual specific projects, and all of them are contained withing the *core* tree (inside `projects/` directory).

Some projects are organized in *full-fledged* structure (e.g. with `include/` and `src/` directories) and other projects (simpler in their core features) are just given as `.cc` sources.

Most of the implementations are done using `C++11` and `C++14` standards.

Local compilation:

* Done on OSX - Catalina
* Using `clang++` provided by XCode
* Build the final repo with `CMake`
*
